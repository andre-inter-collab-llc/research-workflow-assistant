# Research Workflow Assistant

An open-source, modular AI research assistant that runs inside **VS Code + GitHub Copilot**. It connects to academic databases via MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and encodes research best practices through custom Copilot agents. Built for reproducibility, ICMJE compliance, and human-centered research.

> **First time here?** Jump straight to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) below,
> or open Copilot Chat and type `@setup-wizard` for an interactive guided setup.
> For the full walkthrough, see [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Who Is This For?

Any researcher who wants AI-assisted support without surrendering intellectual ownership:

- **NGO and public sector researchers** managing evidence reviews or program evaluations
- **Government analysts** producing policy briefs backed by systematic evidence
- **Academic faculty and postdocs** running systematic reviews or multi-study projects
- **Independent researchers and consultants** needing structured, reproducible workflows
- **Research organizations** wanting standardized, auditable research processes

No PhD required. If you do research, this tool is for you.

## What It Does

| Capability | How |
|---|---|
| **Systematic literature reviews** | `@systematic-reviewer` agent guides PRISMA-compliant workflows: question refinement (PICO/PEO/SPIDER), search strategy development, database searching, screening, data extraction, risk of bias |
| **Academic database access** | MCP servers for PubMed, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, Europe PMC, CrossRef, Scopus (institutional) |
| **Reference management** | Zotero MCP server: search library, add items by DOI, tag, organize collections, export BibTeX |
| **Data analysis** | `@data-analyst` agent generates reproducible R or Python analysis scripts in Quarto documents |
| **Academic writing** | `@academic-writer` agent scaffolds IMRaD manuscripts, manages citations, enforces ICMJE AI disclosure |
| **Research planning** | `@research-planner` agent helps with protocols, ethics applications, study design, grant writing |
| **Project management** | `@project-manager` agent tracks phases, milestones, tasks, decisions; generates progress briefs for colleagues |
| **ICMJE compliance** | Built into every agent: human-in-the-loop mandate, audit trail, AI disclosure generation, authorship checklist |

## ICMJE Compliance: You Are the Author

This tool is designed around the [ICMJE authorship criteria](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html). AI cannot be an author. You must meet all four criteria:

1. **Substantial contributions** to conception, design, data acquisition, analysis, or interpretation
2. **Drafting or critically revising** the work for important intellectual content
3. **Final approval** of the version to be published
4. **Accountability** for all aspects of the work

The tool enforces this by:
- Requiring human decisions at every substantive step
- Tracking AI contributions in an audit trail (`ai-contributions-log.md`)
- Generating ICMJE-compliant AI disclosure statements for your manuscripts
- Refusing to finalize outputs without explicit human review

Per ICMJE Section II.A.4: AI use must be disclosed in acknowledgments (writing assistance) and methods (data analysis). This tool generates those disclosures for you.

## Quick Start

> **Prefer a guided setup?** Open Copilot Chat and type `@setup-wizard`. It will
> walk you through every step interactively.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.99+ with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | Agent mode must be enabled |
| [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/) | Required — runs the MCP servers |
| [R 4.0+](https://www.r-project.org/) | Optional — for R-based analysis templates |
| [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) | Optional — for rendering document templates |
| [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) | Optional — for reference management |

### Step 1 — Clone and open the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-workflow-assistant.git
cd research-workflow-assistant
code .
```

### Step 2 — Create a Python environment and install MCP servers

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all 8 MCP servers in development mode
pip install -e mcp-servers/pubmed-server \
            -e mcp-servers/openalex-server \
            -e mcp-servers/semantic-scholar-server \
            -e mcp-servers/europe-pmc-server \
            -e mcp-servers/crossref-server \
            -e mcp-servers/zotero-server \
            -e mcp-servers/prisma-tracker \
            -e mcp-servers/project-tracker

# Install dev tools (linting, testing)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Step 3 — Configure API keys

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env          # macOS / Linux
copy .env.example .env        # Windows
```

Open `.env` and add your credentials. At minimum:

| Key | Where to get it | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `NCBI_API_KEY` | [NCBI account settings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/settings/) | Recommended |
| `OPENALEX_EMAIL` | Your email address | Recommended |
| `ZOTERO_API_KEY` | [Zotero key settings](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys) | If using Zotero |
| `ZOTERO_USER_ID` | Shown on the same Zotero page | If using Zotero |

Full details: [docs/api-setup-guide.md](docs/api-setup-guide.md)

### Step 4 — Verify everything works

```bash
python scripts/validate_setup.py
```

Or in VS Code: **Ctrl+Shift+P** → "MCP: List Servers" — all 8 servers should appear.

### Step 5 — Start using it

Open Copilot Chat and try an agent:

```
@project-manager Initialize a new project called "my-first-review" in my_projects/my-first-review.
```

See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for the full guide, including project setup, multi-project workflows, and cross-workspace usage.

### Usage examples

```
@systematic-reviewer I want to conduct a systematic review on the effectiveness
of community health worker interventions for maternal mental health in low- and
middle-income countries.
```

```
@project-manager Initialize a new project for my systematic review. Target
completion is September 2026.
```

```
@data-analyst I have extracted data from 23 studies. Help me set up a
random-effects meta-analysis using the metafor package in R.
```

## Database Access

| Database | API | Access | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| PubMed/MEDLINE | NCBI E-utilities | Free | API key (recommended) |
| OpenAlex | REST API | Free, fully open | Email (polite pool) |
| Semantic Scholar | Academic Graph API | Free (rate limited) | API key (optional) |
| Europe PMC | REST API | Free | None |
| CrossRef | REST API | Free | Email (polite pool) |
| Zotero | Web API v3 | Free | API key |
| Scopus | Elsevier API | Institutional | API key |

Databases without APIs (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library): the agents help you build database-specific queries, but you run the searches manually and import results.

## Reporting Standards

The tool supports multiple systematic review reporting standards (user selects):
- **PRISMA 2020** (systematic reviews with meta-analysis)
- **PRISMA-ScR** (scoping reviews)
- **MOOSE** (meta-analyses of observational studies)
- **Cochrane Handbook** methods
